This repository contains the datasets and analysis code of the manuscript "Afternoon to early evening bright light exposure reduces later melatonin production in adolescents". The datasets are licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0, while all R code is licensed under MIT.

Description
This repository contains the code and data used for the analysis in the manuscript titled "Lack of evidence for the contribution of cone photoreceptors to human melatonin suppression and alerting response to light at night" submitted to iScience. The analysis explores the effects of different light conditions (BL, BG, S-cone, M-L, and S+M+L) on melatonin secretion (measured as AUC) and subjective alertness (KSS scores).
The code is written in R and includes functions for data preprocessing, statistical modeling using Bayesian analysis, and the generation of plots. 

Dataset names
Melatonin_KSS_data: Dataset containing the melatonin concenteration levels and Subjective sleepiness/alertness ratings (kss) with 30-min and hourly intervals.
AUC_AvgKSS_data: Dataset containing the melatonin AUC and average KSS data in different light condition.
